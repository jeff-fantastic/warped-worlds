# Important
Hello. If you're reading this, that means I have ceased production on the project "Super Mario 64: Warped Worlds". This is a very tough decision to make, to let go of a project I am so passionate for, but I think it is for the better. I was very oblivious as to what I was getting myself into early on, both in terms of the people I associated myself with and the Super Mario 64 community in general. For months I have put up with numerous individuals that have taken advantage of my trust and have confidential information either about myself or the project (Warped Worlds).

I've dealt with so many people that have the power to put the project or me in danger, and I am sick of it. I am so sorry to let you all down like this, but this is the only way I can really handle this issue without myself getting hurt. If I were to push these people away from me, they would've leaked out confidential information either about me or the project. If I were to let them stay, they would eat away at me mentally.

I do not want to let this project go with a whimper, though. I would like to share with you all the source code and many of the major builds of this project. I feel like you all deserve it for putting so much faith into me and all of the amazing people that put their time into this. Thank you all for sticking by my side for nearly a year now, I truly appreciate you all.

# Builds
Build patch files are available in /builds/. You will need a patcher program and a US rom of SM64. Changelogs are not available between builds, but approximate dates are provided.

# Source Code
Source code is available in /src/. You will need a US rom of SM64. My code is reaaaally messy, since I've worked on this since I first started learning C. Everything should work fine though.
